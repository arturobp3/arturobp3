# üëã Hi there, I'm Arturo!

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I'm **Arturo**, a **Backend Software Engineer** with almost **5 years** of experience building **scalable**, **robust** systems using **Java** and **Python**, primarily in **cloud environments** like **AWS** and **GCP**.

Throughout my career, I've contributed to **high-demand sectors** like **banking**, designing and developing **microservices**, **event-driven architectures**, and **serverless solutions** that serve **thousands of users** daily.

I'm passionate about writing **clean**, **well-tested code**, following best practices such as **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, **hexagonal architecture**, and an **API First** approach.

What truly sets me apart is not just the technical side ‚ú®: I'm a **communicative**, **proactive developer** who thrives on **understanding the real problem behind the code** and **delivering value through collaboration and teamwork**.
